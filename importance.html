          <h2>Why is big data analytics important?</h2>
          <p>
            Big data analytics helps organizations harness their data and use it
            to identify new opportunities. That, in turn, leads to smarter
            business moves, more efficient operations, higher profits and
            happier customers. In his report Big Data in Big Companies, IIA
            Director of Research Tom Davenport interviewed more than 50
            businesses to understand how they used big data. He found they got
            value in the following ways:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Cost reduction.</b> Big data technologies such as Hadoop and
              cloud-based analytics bring significant cost advantages when it
              comes to storing large amounts of data – plus they can identify
              more efficient ways of doing business.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Faster, better decision making.</b> With the speed of Hadoop
              and in-memory analytics, combined with the ability to analyze new
              sources of data, businesses are able to analyze information
              immediately – and make decisions based on what they’ve learned.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b> New products and services.</b> With the ability to gauge
              customer needs and satisfaction through analytics comes the power
              to give customers what they want. Davenport points out that with
              big data analytics, more companies are creating new products to
              meet customers’ needs.
